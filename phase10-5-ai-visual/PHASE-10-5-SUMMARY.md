### 🚀 Key AI Capabilities

#### Intelligent Scene-to-Map Generation
```typescript
// AI analyzes any scene description and creates appropriate visuals
const scene = "The party enters a dimly lit tavern with a roaring fireplace"

// AI automatically:
// 1. Detects location type: "tavern"  
// 2. Creates tavern layout with fireplace
// 3. Places character tokens near entrance
// 4. Adds interactive bar/table zones
// 5. Sets warm, dim lighting atmosphere
```

#### Dynamic Character Management  
```typescript
// Player action: "I walk to the bar and talk to the bartender"

// AI automatically:
// 1. Moves player token to bar area
// 2. Creates "Bartender" NPC token
// 3. Adds "Bar" interaction zone
// 4. Updates all players' views in real-time
```

#### Smart Location Transitions
```typescript
// AI detects scene change: "You head upstairs to the inn's second floor"

// AI automatically:
// 1. Recognizes location transition
// 2. Generates new "inn second floor" map
// 3. Transfers character tokens to new map
// 4. Creates appropriate room layout with doors/beds
```

#### Atmospheric Intelligence
```typescript
// Scene: "The ancient crypt fills with an ominous presence"

// AI automatically:
// 1. Adjusts map colors to darker tones
// 2. Creates "Ominous Altar" interaction zone
// 3. Plays appropriate ambient sounds
// 4. Updates lighting to "dark/mysterious"
```
