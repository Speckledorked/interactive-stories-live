## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **PostgreSQL** 15+ with **pgvector extension** ⚠️ **REQUIRED**
- **OpenAI API** key
- **Pusher** account for real-time features
- **Stripe** account for payment processing (optional for development)

### ⚠️ Important: pgvector Requirement

This application uses PostgreSQL's `pgvector` extension for the Campaign Memory RAG system. You **must** install this extension before running the application.

**Easiest option:** Use Docker (pgvector is pre-installed)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Alternative:** Install pgvector manually
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
./scripts/setup-pgvector.sh

# macOS
brew install pgvector
```

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-stories-live.git
cd interactive-stories-live

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start PostgreSQL with pgvector
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set:
#   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://pguser:pgpassword@localhost:5432/interactive_stories"
#   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
#   PUSHER_* variables
#   JWT_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)

# 5. Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# 6. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.
