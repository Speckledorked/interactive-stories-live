### 🚀 Key Capabilities (Redesigned)

#### Unlimited Downtime Activities
```typescript
// Player describes ANYTHING they want to do
"I want to learn the ancient draconic language from the scholar we rescued"

// AI automatically interprets and creates:
{
  summary: "Study ancient draconic language with rescued scholar",
  estimatedDuration: 28,
  costs: { gold: 100, resources: ["ancient texts", "translation materials"] },
  requirements: ["Find the scholar", "Convince them to teach"],
  skillsInvolved: ["linguistics", "history", "arcana"],
  riskLevel: "medium",
  potentialOutcomes: ["Learn draconic fluency", "Discover ancient secrets"]
}
```

#### AI-Generated Dynamic Events
```typescript
// AI creates events specific to the player's exact activity
"Day 12: While studying an ancient draconic inscription, you notice it seems to 
describe a hidden vault beneath the city. The scholar becomes nervous when you 
point this out. How do you proceed?"

// Choices adapt to the specific situation:
// - Press the scholar for information about the vault
// - Pretend you didn't notice and continue studying
// - Research the vault location independently
```

#### Intelligent Context Awareness
```typescript
// AI considers everything when generating content:
- Character background and skills
- Campaign setting and recent events  
- Previous downtime activities and outcomes
- Relationships with NPCs and factions
- Available resources and time constraints
```

#### Natural Language Responses
```typescript
// Players respond in natural language to events
"I carefully approach the topic with the scholar, sharing that I'm interested 
in historical sites rather than treasure hunting, and ask if they know anything 
about old archives or libraries that might be beneath the city."

// AI generates contextual responses that respect player agency
```

## 🎮 Player Experience Transformation

### Before Redesign ❌
- Limited to predefined activity categories → restricted creativity
- Rigid structure that didn't match player imagination → frustration

- Generic events that didn't match specific player goals → disconnected experience

### After Redesign ✅
- **Complete Creative Freedom**: Describe any downtime activity imaginable - AI makes it happen
- **Personalized Content**: Every event and outcome tailored to your specific activity and character
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: AI adjusts to player creativity instead of forcing preset categories  
- **Meaningful Consequences**: Every choice shapes your ongoing story and character development
- **Natural Interaction**: Communicate with the AI in plain English about your goals and responses
